Android iBeacon Library
=======================

An Android library providing APIs to interact with iBeacons


## What does this library do?

It allows Android devices to use iBeacons much like iOS devices do.  An app can request to get notifications when one
or more iBeacons appear or disappear.  An app can also request to get a ranging update from one or more iBeacons
at a frequency of 1Hz.  

## How to Use this Library

The [project website](http://developer.radiusnetworks.com/ibeacon/android/) is the best place to go if you want
to learn how to use this library.  It includes binary downloads, a quick start guide, sample code, full API docs and even a reference application.

The referencing of a clone of this repository in Eclipse as an Android Library is deprecated, as the project is in the process of migrating from an Eclipse-based build system to a Gradle-based build system.  
This will stop working in the near future.  The preferred way of referencing this library is though the binary downloads.  See the quick start on the project website for more information.
